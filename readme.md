Our project is about implementing an airline reservation website. The goals were to allow the user to choose a destination, access our calendar system, choose an airline, view pricing (including taxes and fees), input their personal information, input their payment information, and confirm their booking. Having these features gives users a clear, efficient route to place a booking. Our information inputting system allows for quick, easy access to general data and price comparison. Having an online reservation system lessens workload of staff and other services. It also reduces chances for errors whether it’s regarding availability or bookings.
6 functional requirements implemented: 
Choosing a destination (Marlon/Alan)
Showing a calendar (Marlon)
Choosing an airline (Alan)
Calculating pricing (Pawan/Mihir)
Getting passenger/payment information (Mihir)
Confirming booking (Pawan)
To install our libraries:
Open command terminal
Type “git commit https://github.com/4-gent/SoaringEagle.git”
Then to install our requirements, type “pip3 install -r Requirements.txt”
Run “run.py” in the main directory by typing python3 run.py
To run our webpage, either copy/paste the URL provided after running the previous command in a browser or type “localhost:5000” to access our homepage.
Our pages included a homepage, flight options, purchasing (pre-booking), purchase confirmation
