# Soaring Eagle

## Overview

Our project is about implementing an airline reservation website. The goals were to allow the user to choose a destination, access our calendar system, choose an airline, view pricing (including taxes and fees), input their personal information, input their payment information, and confirm their booking. Having these features gives users a clear, efficient route to place a booking. Our information inputting system allows for quick, easy access to general data and price comparison. Having an online reservation system lessens workload of staff and other services. It also reduces chances for errors whether itâ€™s regarding availability or bookings.
